  - Goal of this project is to make an application that manages TODO tasks.

- ## Plan
  - Create Server insatance (considering public cloud or on-premise enviornment)
  - Set MySQL-server on instance and build image by using docker
  - Develop TODO-App server program and build image
    - Two possibilities :
        1. Create and run two containers with both images
        2. Create only one container and run both processes on it (MySQL & TODO-App server program
    - TODO-App server program also will be managed as a project on github
